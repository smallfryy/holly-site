# js-going-native
Hello, World! This is a native lightbox JavaScript application using the Flickr API.

## Description
So, why no JQuery? In this project I'm going "under the hood" of AJAX Requests in native JavaScript. I wont be using any libraries or frameworks other than raw JavaScript. This is a great chance to consider whether using JQuery is necessary in client-side js applications!

## Technologies used
- JavaScript
- Flickr API

## User Experience
1. User arrives at page and sees a grid of images.
2. User clicks on an image and sees it expand, lightbox-style, on the page with corresponding title.

4. User clicks on another image and sees it expand on the page.
5. User is able to naviagte through photo library.
